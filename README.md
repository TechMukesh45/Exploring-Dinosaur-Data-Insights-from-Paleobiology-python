Delve into the world of dinosaurs with the "Exploring Dinosaur Data: Insights from Paleobiology" project! This project, part of the second "Everyone Can Learn Data" Scholarship from DataCamp, invites students to analyze a real dataset containing dinosaur records from the Paleobiology Database. Participants will uncover fascinating insights such as the diversity of dinosaur names, the largest dinosaur species, and trends in dinosaur body size over time. Using Python coding skills and creative thinking, students will visualize their findings, create interactive maps, and explore the spatial distribution of dinosaur fossils across the globe. Get ready to embark on a prehistoric adventure and win $5,000 for your future data science studies!
